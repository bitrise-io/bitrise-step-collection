  Deploy to iTunes Connect, using the
  fantastic [Shenzhen](https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen)
  Ruby gem.

  **If this is the very first build** of the app
  you try to deploy to iTunes Connect then you might want to upload the first
  build manually to make sure it fulfills the initial iTunes Connect submission
  verification process.

  ## Setup guide and notes

  * Register an app on iTunes Connect, on the **My Apps** page. Click on the *plus sign* and select the **New iOS App** option. This requires an **admin** account.
  * Requires an **App Store iOS distibution Provisioning Profile**
  * Every build which you want to push to iTunes Connect have to have a **unique build and version number** pair (*increment either or both before a new deploy to iTunes Connect*)
